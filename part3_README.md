## Final Project - Part 3

This part is about showing off your work by building a website for your portfolio. Read the instructions below for what is needed.

## Step 0 - (New!) Engine Architecture Diagram

Your project should have an 'engine architecture' diagram on your website which describes the major components of the engine. See [./media/C4Engine.pdf](./media/C4Engine.pdf) as an example. Note, some IDEs can automatically generate these, though you can draw it yourself and highlight the most important components. Think of this as a high-level diagram you would give an engineer the first day of work so they would know the components and how they interact if they want to modify the engine.

## Step 1 - Documentation

Now that you are going to be maintaining the code for your company for many years, it is important to properly document your code. You will continue to use 'Doxygen' <a href="http://www.doxygen.nl/">(Doxygen webpage)</a> or [Doxypress](https://www.copperspice.com/documentation-doxypress.html) to document the source code and automatically generate .html pages. Your documentation should cover your classes and functions.

An example of a well documented probjects can be found here: 

- https://www.ogre3d.org/docs/api/1.9/
- http://www.horde3d.org/docs/html/_api.html

### Doxygen style comments

Some examples of documentation are listed here: http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html 

Comments within code are in the style of:

```cpp
/*!
 * ... text ...
 */

/*!
 ... text ...
*/

//!
//!... text ...
//!

/*! \brief Brief description.
 *         Brief description continued.
 *
 *  Detailed description starts here.
 */

```
**Note**: A helpful tool to use may be: [Doxywizard](http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/doxywizard_usage.html)

## Step 2 - Build (binary file)
You need to have a compiled binary of your game for your operating system (Either Windows, Mac, or Linux). You can assume a target audience of either a 64-bit Mac, Ubuntu Linux, or a Windows 10 machine. There should additionally be instructions about how to compile your code from source. The compilation should be trivial (running `python build.py` for example, or listing a series of 'apt-get install' in a single command or a script you have built. **Make it trivial** so customers/course staff do not get frustrated :) ).

## Step 3 - Post mortem
A post mortem in games is a look back at what could be improved. Write a brief (2-3 paragraphs) on what could be improved if you had an additional 8 weeks to work on this project. Where would you allocate time, what tools would you build, would you use any different tools, etc.

*Edit here a draft of your post mortem here if you like--the final copy goes in your 1-page .html website. Think of this section as a good 'reflection' for what you can improve on your next project you complete.*

## Step 4 - Website

I think it is incredibly important to build a portfolio of your game development works! You will be building a 1 page website(it can be all html) to market your assignment. You can re-use this template for your next project, and potentially other personal projects.

The following are the requirements for a 1-page .html page.

1. Provide a 1 minute video trailer followed by at least 3 screenshots of your game (order matters, video first, then screenshots below)
2. Your documentation (i.e. a link to your doxygen generated files)
3. **An image** of your engine architecture.
4. A link to your binary
5. A short post mortem (i.e. A few paragraphs describing how you would take the project further, what went well, and what you would change if given another month on the project) should be put together on a 1-page .html page. 

This website will be the first place I look to grab your project files and binaries. 

[Please edit and put a link to your website here](./Engine/README.md)

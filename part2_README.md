# Part 2

The **key** components for your project are:

1. The C++ engine that does the heavy lifting and management of game objects and resources
2. A simple to use editor for building games (e.g. a GUI-based tile editor)
3. A game built in your engine (i.e. a class or simple game). 

## Requirements

The following are requirements of your game engine. There is significant freedom in how you achieve them, but I would like you to apply these techniques in your engine.

- [ ] Implement a resource manager
- [ ] Implement a GUI-based editor/environment for building your game (i.e. An extension of the tilemap editor)
- [ ] Your engine must be data-driven
  - [ ] Scripts should be loaded for the gameplay logic
  - [ ] Other configuration files (e.g. levels) should be loaded at run-time.
- [ ] Your engine should be component-based **or** use some other logical pattern for organizing game objects (At a minimum you should have a gameobject class).
- [ ] Something **extra** that gives your engine a 'wow' factor to show off to the TA's and instructors. Highlight this in your video (could be engineering, could be a gameplay mechanic that you designed your engine around, the goal is that it is something non-trivial)

## Gameplan

Given the above requirements, you may use this space to write some notes in. I suggest coming up with a timeline with your team members.

For example:

1. Week 1 - Form groups and agree on project, start dividing some responsibilities
2. Week 2 - Gather resources,  from previous assignments and start planning
3. Week 3 - 5 Implementation of Editor and main components of engine
4. Week 6 - Continue iterating on engine, and build prototype of game.
5. Week 7 - Put together website and polish off bugs

	* Game Engine -- with tools
		* https://cs5850-final.firebaseapp.com/media/final.webm
	* This was an asteroids game engine which focused on spatial partioning.
		* I liked the editor and the application of the spatial partioning with debug mode.

* Spring 2021
	* Ninja Frogs -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5u7iUSrOjEE
		* Nice demonstration of editor and game running. 
	* Ubihard Engine -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DtXk1N2WQM
		* Good demonstration of integrating tooling with editor.
	* Bubble Bobble Engine - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZA6Ytb3WXg
		* Another nice enigne pulling together components.
